          A series of explosions at military depots and airbases in
          Russian-annexed Crimea hint at a growing ability to strike deep behind
          enemy lines that could shift the dynamics of the war.

          DNIPRO,Ukraine â€” Pro-Ukrainian saboteurs were involved in the recent
          spate of explosions at Russian military sites in Crimea, a Ukrainian
          government official told NBC News. The series of blasts hit military
          depots and airbases in the annexed peninsula over the past week,
          hinting at a growing ability by Ukraine's military or its backers to
          strike deep behind enemy lines, a development that could shift the
          dynamics of the war.
